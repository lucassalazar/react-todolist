# To Do List App Using React

I made this project to learn a little bit more about React.
The main focus was to build an app just using react, so the style was made just with simple CSS.

In this app, the user can add/remove tasks from the list and mark them when they are completed.

## About React

What is react?

* React is a Javascript library created by Facebook and is used for building user interfaces (UIs) and front-end applications
* React is often called a framework because of it's behavior and capabilities

## Why use react?

* Makes front-end Javascript much easier
* Uses self contained, independent components with their own state
* Much more interactive UIs
* Virtual DOM
* JSX - Easily incorporate JS in markup (HTML)
* Easy to work with teams

## React state

* Components can have state which is an object that determines how that component renders and behaves
* React can also have an "application level" state by using a state manager like Redux or Reacts own context API 

## How to create React apps?

* CLI Tool for creating React applications (create-react-app)
* Uses Webpack but need no configuration from the developer
* Comes bundled with a dev server with hot reload
* "npm run build" will compile all the code to something that the browser can read

## Anatomy of a component

    Class Post extends React.Component {
        state = {
            title: 'Post One',
            body: 'This is a post'
        }

        render() {
            return() {
                <div>
                    <h3>{ this.state.title }</h3>
                    <p>{ this.state.body }</p>
                </div>
            }
        }
    }
